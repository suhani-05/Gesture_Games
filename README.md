This is a gesture controlled pong game.

The Pong game created using gesture control allows players to interact with the game using hand movements, replacing traditional keyboard or mouse inputs. In this version, players control the paddle using the movement of their index finger, tracked via a webcam. The game features two paddles, one controlled by the player and the other by the computer, with the objective being to hit the ball back and forth. The gesture recognition system ensures responsive and fluid control, adding an intuitive, immersive experience. Players can track their score, and the game speeds up with time to increase the challenge. This interactive gameplay merges classic Pong mechanics with modern gesture technology for a fresh, hands-free twist on the iconic game.
